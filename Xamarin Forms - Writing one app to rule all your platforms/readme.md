##Abstract

Are you seeking the *Holy Grail* of *Write Once Run Anywhere* app development? Then **Xamarin Forms** might be what you are looking for. This session will give you the information you need to understand Xamarin Forms and how it can be used to *lower the friction* of cross platform mobile development. You will see how easy it is to *simultaneously* create your app for **iOS**, **Android**, and **Windows Phone**.

##Demo code
The **Demo** folder includes the completed and working code for the demo app that was created during my session. There are some special considerations for using the DEMO code:
* You will need to *restore the NuGet packages* in order to run the solution. You can do this from inside VisualStudio or from the command line using the nuget tool:
      nuget.exe restore NCCXamarinDemo.sln

* You will need at least a trial version of Xamarin for iOS or Android to build and run the respective projects.
