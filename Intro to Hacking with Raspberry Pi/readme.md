These are the slides for my talk on hacking with the Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi pin layouts, wiring diagrams, code examples (with documentation) are
available at [https://github.com/geekygirlsarah/intro_to_hacking_raspberry_pi](https://github.com/geekygirlsarah/intro_to_hacking_raspberry_pi)

Please contact me on Twitter or via email (my first name at first name last 
name dot com) if you have questions or want to show off any projects you've 
built! Feel free to let me know how I could make the talk better.

I'll be giving a fresh, revised version of this talk at the 
[Kansas City Developers Conference](http://www.kcdc.info/#!/). Hope to see you 
there!
